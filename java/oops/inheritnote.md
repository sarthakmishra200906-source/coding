--------inheritance-----
inheretince is when properties and method of base class are pased on to a derived class.
->extend function is used to bring all the property of parent class to child class if parrent class is class Animal the to bring property to child we write class Fish extends Animal
----- Type of inheritance  ------
->They are of 4 type -:
1. single level inheritance 
    ->It consist of only one base class and one derived class as we saw in example of animal class (base) and fish class(derived).
2. Multi level inheratance 
   ->It consist of a base class and then derived class and then another derived class (1 base 2 derived ) for ex animal is base case then mammel is derived from animal then dog it is derived from mammel 
3. hirerachial inheritance 
   -> it consist of one base case and many derived case for that single base case for example class animal but it may consist of fish property swim bird property fly mammel property walk but all have some thing common they all eat they all breath which will be in base case animal
