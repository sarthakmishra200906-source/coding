    <p>“If we don’t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland.<br> And we’re not going to have Russia or China as
        a neighbour,” Trump said at a meeting with oil and gas executives at the White House.<br>
        “I would like to make a deal, you know, the easy way.<br> But if we don’t do it the easy way, we’re going to do
        it the hard way,” he added.<br>
        Since the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last week from Caracas in a military operation, Trump
        and his officials have upped the ante against the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk.<br>

        So, what are the ways that US President Trump could take control of Greenland, a territory of Denmark?</p>
