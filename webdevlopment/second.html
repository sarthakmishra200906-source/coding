    <p>“If we don’t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland.<br> And we’re not going to have Russia or China as
        a neighbour,” Trump said at a meeting with oil and gas executives at the White House.<br>
        “I would like to make a deal, you know, the easy way.<br> But if we don’t do it the easy way, we’re going to do
        it the hard way,” he added.<br>
        Since the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last week from Caracas in a military operation, Trump
        and his officials have upped the ante against the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk.<br>

        So, what are the ways that US President Trump could take control of Greenland, a territory of Denmark?</p>

        <h1>Is Trump considering paying out Greenlanders?</h1>
        <p>Paying out to Greenland’s nearly 56,000-strong population is an option that White House officials have been
            reportedly discussing.

            Located mostly within the Arctic Circle, Greenland is the world’s largest island, with 80 percent of its
            land covered by glaciers. Nuuk, the capital, is the most populated area, home to about one-third of the
            population.

            Trump’s officials have discussed sending payments to Greenlanders – ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per
            person – according to a Reuters report, in a bid to convince them to secede from Denmark and potentially
            join Washington.Greenland is formally a part of Denmark, with its own elected government and rules over most
            of its internal affairs, including control over natural resources and governance. Copenhagen still handles
            foreign policy, defence and Greenland’s finances.But since 2009, Greenland has the right to secede if its
            population votes for independence in a referendum. In theory, payouts to Greenland residents could be an
            attempt to influence their vote.

            Trump shared his ambitions of annexing Greenland during his first term as well, terming it “essentially a
            large real estate deal.”

            If the US government were to pay $100,000 to each Greenland resident, the total bill for this effort would
            amount to about $5.6bn.</p>

        <h1>Can the US ‘buy’ Greenland?</h1>
        <p>Earlier this week, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt confirmed to reporters on Wednesday that Trump’s
            officials are “actively” discussing a potential offer to buy the Danish territory.

            During a briefing on Monday with lawmakers from both chambers of Congress, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio
            told them that Trump would prefer to buy Greenland rather than invade it. Rubio is scheduled to hold talks
            with Danish leaders next week.

            Both Nuuk and Copenhagen have repeatedly insisted that the island “is not for sale”.

            There are few modern historical precedents to compare Trump’s threats with Greenland, much like the
            abduction of Maduro on his orders.

            The US purchased Louisiana from France in 1803 for $15m and Alaska from Russia in 1867 for $7.2m. However,
            both France and Russia were willing sellers — unlike Denmark and Greenland today.

            Washington has also purchased territory from Denmark in the past. In 1917, the US, under President Woodrow
            Wilson, bought the Danish West Indies for $25m during World War I, later renaming them the United States
            Virgin Islands.</p>

        <h1>Can Trump really just pay off his way?</h1>
        <p>While Greenlanders have been open to departing from Denmark, the population has repeatedly refused to be a
            part of the US. Nearly 85 percent of the population rejects the idea, according to a 2025 poll commissioned
            by the Danish paper Berlingske.

            Meanwhile, another poll, by YouGov, shows that only 7 percent of Americans support the idea of a US military
            invasion of the territory.

            Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist and a professor at Columbia University, told Al Jazeera, “The White
            House wants to buy out Greenlanders, not to pay for what Greenland is worth, which is way beyond what the US
            would ever pay <br>“Trump thinks he can buy Greenland on the cheap, not for what it’s worth to Denmark or
            Europe,” he said. “This attempt to negotiate directly with the Greenlanders is an affront and threat to
            Danish and European sovereignty.”

            Denmark and the European Union “should make clear that Trump should stop this abuse of European
            sovereignty,” said Sachs. “Greenland should not be for sale or capture by the US.”

            Sachs added that the EU needs to assess “[Greenland’s] enormous value as a geostrategic region in the
            Arctic, filled with resources, vital for Europe’s military security.” And, he added, “certainly not a
            plaything of the United States and its new emperor”.

            Denmark and the US were among the 12 founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
            1949 to provide collective security against Soviet expansion.

            “Europe should tell the US imperialists to go away,” Sachs said. “[Today] Europe is far more likely to be
            invaded from the West (US) than from the East,” the economist told Al Jazeera</p>
